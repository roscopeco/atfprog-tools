# Little ATF150x Programmer Board
## Software utilities

### What

This repository contains the official standard programmer software and utilities 
for the Little ATF150x Programmer Board.

![Picture of The Little ATF150x Programmer](https://github.com/roscopeco/atfprog-tools/raw/main/images/board.jpeg)

This is a plug-and-play USB-connected programmer and breakout board for
Atmel (Microchip) ATF150{2,4,8}{AS,ASV} CPLDs, featuring:

* Support for JED, SVF or XSVF files
* Support for both PLCC44 and 84 packages on-board
* Ability to drive ICSP via the JTAG headers (single-device only - chains **not** currently supported)
* Ability to erase JTAG-locked and secured devices

The board is **now available** on the on the [rosco_m68k store](https://store.rosco-m68k.com/products/little-atf-programmer) ðŸ¥³

### Software Installation

Prerequisites:

* Recent macOS, Linux or Windows operating system
* Working Python (3.9+) installation
  * Recent macOS and Linux will likely have this by default
  * If not, it can be installed with your package manager
  * Windows users can download from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows
  * `python` and `pip` should be in your `PATH` for easiest installation experience

> **Note**: on some systems, your `python` may instead be named `python3`, with `pip`
> being similarly named `pip3`. As long as Python is version 3.9 or higher 
> (as reported by `python3 --version`) it should work just fine.

#### Latest release

With a Python environment that meets these requirements, installation
is as simple as:

```shell
pip install little-atf-programmer
```

> **Note**: on Windows, when installing you may receive a message from pip
> warning that the installed binaries are not in your `PATH`. If you see this,
> for easier installation you may wish to add the directory in the warning
> to your `PATH` by editing in
> `Control Panel / System / Advanced / Environment Variables.`

#### From source

Developers and project collaborators may wish to install from source. 

To do this, clone the project from GitHub (or grab a source tarball).

Then either run `python src/atfu.py` or install with pip if you like:

```shell
pip install .
```

If you're hacking on the code, you'll probably want to install it `--editable`.

### Usage

#### General arguments

General command line arguments look like this:

```
atfu [-h] [--version] [-q] [-v] [-t] {program,erase,check,programmer} ...

Little ATF150x Programmer Board Utility

positional arguments:
  {program,erase,check,programmer}
    program             Program an ATF150x device
    erase               Erase an ATF150x device
    check               Check if an ATF150x device is blank
    programmer          Little ATF150x Programmer Board device functions

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -q, --quiet           Silence almost all output
  -v, --verbose         Allow additional output
  -t, --trace           Enable debugging output (can be noisy!)
```

#### Program mode

This mode is used to program JEDEC, SVF or XSVF files to an ATF150x device.

By default, the first detected programmer will be used. This can be changed
with the `-p` option.

If you have problems programming, try erasing first with the `-e` option,
or force-erasing with the `-f` option, which can be useful when you have a
JTAG-locked or secured device.

```
atfu program [-h] [-e] [-f] [-d {ATF1502,ATF1504,ATF1508}] [-p PROGRAMMER] filename [filename ...]

positional arguments:
  filename              .jed, .svf or .xsvf file(s) to program

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e, --erase           Erase before programming
  -f, --force           Force-erase before programming (implies -e)
  -d {ATF1502AS,ATF1504AS,ATF1508AS,ATF1502ASV,ATF1504ASV,ATF1508ASV}, --device {ATF1502AS,ATF1504AS,ATF1508AS,ATF1502ASV,ATF1504ASV,ATF1508ASV}
                        Device to program (default: ATF1502AS)
  -p PROGRAMMER, --programmer PROGRAMMER
                        Programmer device (default: /dev/cu.usbmodem14301)
```

#### Erase mode

This mode is used to erase an ATF150x device, and can also be used to 
force erase JTAG-locked or secured devices.

> **Note** that the force mode might be... _stressful_ for your device.

```
usage: atfu erase [-h] [-f] [-p PROGRAMMER] [-d {ATF1502,ATF1504,ATF1508}]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f, --force           Force erase
  -p PROGRAMMER, --programmer PROGRAMMER
                        Programmer device (default: /dev/cu.usbmodem14301)
  -d {ATF1502AS,ATF1504AS,ATF1508AS,ATF1502ASV,ATF1504ASV,ATF1508ASV}, --device {ATF1502AS,ATF1504AS,ATF1508AS,ATF1502ASV,ATF1504ASV,ATF1508ASV}
                        Device to erase (default: ATF1502AS)
```

#### Check mode

This mode is used to determine whether an ATF150x device is blank.

> **Note** Devices that cannot be communicated with will show up as `not blank`.
> In practice, this will always be either faulty, JTAG-locked or secured devices.
> For the former, it doesn't matter if they're blank or not, and for the latter,
> well, it's not possible for them to be blank anyhow...

```
atfu check [-h] [-p PROGRAMMER] [-d {ATF1502,ATF1504,ATF1508}]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PROGRAMMER, --programmer PROGRAMMER
                        Programmer device (default: /dev/cu.usbmodem14301)
  -d {ATF1502AS,ATF1504AS,ATF1508AS,ATF1502ASV,ATF1504ASV,ATF1508ASV}, --device {ATF1502AS,ATF1504AS,ATF1508AS,ATF1502ASV,ATF1504ASV,ATF1508ASV}
                        Device to check (default: ATF1502AS)
```

#### Programmer mode

This mode can be used to list detected programmer boards, and query them.

```
atfu programmer [-h] {list,query} ...

positional arguments:
  {list,query}

options:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit


atfu programmer list [-h] [--plain]

Functions for listing connected programmers

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --plain     Display a plain list of device paths
```
